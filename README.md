## Design:

The 720HD app was designed and built from scratch in 10 days. The proposal was prepared to implement MVPs to get site functional. More details about proposal can be viewed [here](https://github.com/tonywzhang/720HD/wiki).

## Technologies Used:

    * Backend
        This full stack project employs ruby on rails v 5.2.0 for implementing back-end.
        Databases are managed by PostgreSQL.
        The backend is implemented to provide RESTful APIs and handle and respond with JSON data.
    * Front-end
        The front end and UI are implemented using React/Redux and JavaScript.
        Using react allows the state of the project to be normalized to reflect database and hence making the flow of one-page application smooth.
        The back-end uses SQL queries for filtering data and front end uses VanillaDOM manipulation.
        The webpage designing was done using css and scss and icons were used from fontawesome.com.
        Babel was used for transpiling JSX into JavaScript.
